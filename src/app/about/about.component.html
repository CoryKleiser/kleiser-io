<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Cory Kleiser is currently a Systems Engineer for Cognizant Technology Solutions</h2>
<h3>Programmer</h3>
<p>I have great familiarity with the object oriented approach to design and development. Most of my experience derives from developing applications on the client-side. My language of choice is most definitely javascript and it's various frameworks.</p>
<h3>Multimedia Developer</h3>
<p>Although my studies are primarily focused in web development, I am a competent producer of many other mediums. The experience and knowledge I gain when creating various types of content is invaluable when I am developing an application or website.</p>
